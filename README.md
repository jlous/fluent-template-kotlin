fluent-template-kotlin
=============
Friendly kotlin wrapper around NamedParameterTemplate from Spring-jdbc.

NOT intended to be a query builder - still based on free-form SQL for max flexibility and familiarity.

Goals
------
* Encourage naming SQL params by making it the most straightforward way to code queries
* Replace the cluttered API of NamedParameterTemplate with a clearer and more readable one
* Design the API specifically to leverage code-completion for feature discovery and ease of authoring
* Enable client code that expresses intent as clearly as possible - within practical limits
